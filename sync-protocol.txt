The stash servers are able to synchronise amongst themselves, and this 
protocol is used to do it.

slave server needs to login using an account that has the SYNC right.

Then can do a synch request.

Slav can do a subscribe request, which means that when updates occur on 
the server, those updates will be sent to the slave also.


Challenges.
When the master server is running, it has in-memory a map of how things 
are at that particular moment.
When a slave connects and asks for all the transactions since a 
particular one, then it will have to load in the files to find that 
transaction and transmit all the new ones since then.   This could be 
time consuming if the slaves are all popping in at the same time... so 
it would need to be a little smart and cache things for a bit....
that can all be handled during performance upgrades though.
