stash
tasks to do


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

when deleting a table or a namespace, need to go through each user and check the rights list and remove all rights that point to the 
table or namespace we are deleting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

library interface: locksets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stashd needs to handle locking of tables/names.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create tool to revoke rights.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create tool to backup data sources (force a datafile split, and backup everything except that last file).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create tool to compact the data source
	* load in everything and cross reference it with a transaction id.  Make a note of any clashes.
	* load data in again, this time processing the data, looking at the cross reference clashes and 
	  only write out things that havent clashed.
	* write out the files with the redundant data removed.
	* this would use a lot of memory, so it wont be able to cross reference everything.   
		Maybe have to do it in cycles.  
			* load in X number of transactions.  
			* Go through the rest of the data to see if any of them clash.  
			* Write out adjusted values
			* load in X more, and so on, till the end.
	* when finished, need to rename the compacted file back to the original.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create tool that loads in the stash and the namespaces and reports any errors with the file.  As features are added, functionality 
should be added to this tool to detect possible problem.

	* for example, when tables are created, they are given an ID.  Report any instance where an ID is referenced that is invalid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the connections need to take the priority into account when establishing connections.  First iteration allows for it to just attempt 
the first, and if that drops off, try the next... and so on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stashd does not shutdown cleanly while a client is connected.
  stashd: stashd.c:501: client_shutdown: Assertion `client->closing == 0' failed.
